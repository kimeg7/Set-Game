# Set-Game
The set game involves one or more players in finding sets under specified conditions.

Rule       : Find three cards which can be considered as a "set".
Attributes : Shape (square, triangle, circle) , Color (red, yellow, blue) , Background Color (white, brown, gray)
Criteria   : A set consists of three cards that satisfy one of the following conditions.

1. All three cards share same elements in one of the attributes (ex. all reds but different elements in other attributes for example)
2. All three cards share same elements in two of the attributes (ex. all reds AND all browns but different elements in the remaining attribute)

3. All three cards DO NOT share elements in ALL of the attributes (different colors, shapes, and background colors)

Buttons    : Reset (shuffles the board in a random fashion)
             Noset (Click this if you have found all sets thus there are no remaining sets left on the board)
             Exit  (Thank you for playing, there will be improvements made for better quality.)
